Empress Jessamine Kaldwin's last hope to eradicate this plague was to send her own bodyguard Corvo Attano away on look out for cure to the epidemic. During Corvo's return to Dunwall Empress Jessamine Kaldwin was assassinated and he was blamed for the happening.</p>

These men are Lord Pendleton's despised older brothers, twins, and they are loyal to the tyrannical Lord Regent. Corvo has to find Emily at the Golden Cat and eliminate Lords Custis and Morgan Pendleton.</p><br>

However, three women in the Boyle Family are referred to as Lady Boyle: The wife of the late Lord Boyle and her sisters.
